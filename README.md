Imagine that during a technical interview you are given the following problem, which you need to solve using a heap.

There are several network cables of different lengths, and you need to combine them two at a time into one cable, using connectors, in an order that results in the lowest total cost.
The cost of connecting two cables is equal to the sum of their lengths, and the total cost is the sum of all individual connection costs.

The task is to find the order of combining the cables that minimizes the total cost.
